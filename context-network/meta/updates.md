# Context Network Updates

This file tracks significant updates to the context network structure and content.

## Context Network Update: Deno-Specific Custom Instructions - 2025-05-18

### Information Nodes Modified/Created
- Created `inbox/deno-custom-instructions-prompt.md`: Tailored version of custom instructions for Deno development projects

### Content Changes
- Updated domain terminology to reflect Deno-specific artifacts
- Added Deno-specific directory structure recommendations
- Included Deno-specific domain classifications (Runtime, Security, Modules, TypeScript, etc.)
- Added Deno-specific relationship types
- Added new sections for Deno Security Considerations and Deno Module Management
- Enhanced Implementation Mode guidelines with Deno best practices

### Navigation Implications
- The new custom instructions provide a more tailored guide for maintaining context networks in Deno projects
- Future Deno projects should consider using the Deno-specific instructions for better context organization

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Test the Deno-specific instructions in real-world Deno projects to validate effectiveness
- Consider creating additional custom instruction variants for other specific technologies
- Periodically update the Deno-specific instructions as the Deno ecosystem evolves

## Context Network Update: Deno Knowledge Integration - 2025-05-18

### Information Nodes Modified/Created
- Created `elements/deno/overview.md`: High-level overview of Deno, its key features, and positioning in the JavaScript runtime ecosystem
- Created `elements/deno/architecture.md`: Detailed explanation of Deno's technical architecture and component interactions
- Created `elements/deno/security_model.md`: Comprehensive description of Deno's permission-based security model
- Created `elements/deno/module_resolution.md`: Explanation of Deno's module resolution and package management approach
- Created `elements/deno/typescript_compilation.md`: Details on how Deno handles JavaScript and TypeScript compilation
- Created `elements/deno/testing.md`: Information on Deno's built-in testing and benchmarking capabilities
- Created `elements/deno/best_practices.md`: Recommended patterns and practices for Deno development
- Created `elements/deno/frameworks.md`: Overview of available frameworks and libraries in the Deno ecosystem
- Created `elements/deno/development_workflow.md`: Guide to the complete development lifecycle for Deno applications

### New Relationships Established
- `elements/deno/overview.md` → is-parent-of → All other Deno nodes
- `elements/deno/architecture.md` → closely-related → `elements/deno/security_model.md`
- `elements/deno/security_model.md` → implements → `elements/deno/best_practices.md`
- `elements/deno/module_resolution.md` → depends-on → `elements/deno/architecture.md`
- `elements/deno/typescript_compilation.md` → relates-to → `elements/deno/testing.md`
- `elements/deno/testing.md` → implements → `elements/deno/best_practices.md`
- `elements/deno/frameworks.md` → complements → `elements/deno/best_practices.md`
- `elements/deno/development_workflow.md` → incorporates → `elements/deno/testing.md`
- `elements/deno/development_workflow.md` → implements → `elements/deno/best_practices.md`
- `elements/deno/development_workflow.md` → utilizes → `elements/deno/frameworks.md`

### Navigation Implications
- New `elements/deno` directory serves as a dedicated knowledge area for Deno-related information
- Navigation structure follows a logical progression from high-level overview to specific aspects of Deno
- Cross-referencing between nodes allows for targeted exploration of related concepts

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Create process documentation for Deno development in the `processes` directory
- Consider adding architectural decision records for Deno-specific decisions
- Integrate the Deno knowledge into existing project documentation if Deno will be used as a technology
- Consider expanding with real-world examples and case studies based on actual project experiences
- Update periodically as Deno evolves and new versions are released

## Context Network Update: Initial Context Network Setup - 2025-05-01

### Information Nodes Created
- Created basic directory structure
- Created foundation documents
- Created meta documentation
- Set up initial relationships

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Continue populating with project-specific information
- Develop more detailed process documentation
- Add decision records as architectural decisions are made
