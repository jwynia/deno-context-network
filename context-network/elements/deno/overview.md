### What is Deno?

Deno is a modern, secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. Created by Ryan Dahl (the original creator of Node.js), Deno addresses several design issues in Node.js while embracing modern JavaScript features.

### Core Principles

Deno is built on several key principles:

1. **Security First**: Deno operates on a permissions-based security model where scripts cannot access files, networks, or environment variables without explicit permission.

2. **Modern JavaScript**: Deno fully supports ES modules and does not use a package.json file or node_modules directory. Dependencies are imported directly via URLs.

3. **TypeScript Integration**: Deno has first-class TypeScript support, allowing developers to run TypeScript code directly without a separate compilation step.

4. **Standard Library**: Deno provides a reviewed standard library that is guaranteed to work with Deno.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: Deno aims to be as browser-compatible as possible, implementing web standards like fetch and the Web Storage API.

### Core Technologies

Deno is built upon three primary technologies:

- **Rust**: Provides a safe, performant, and concurrent foundation for the runtime's core logic, system interactions, and security layers.
- **V8**: Google's open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, used to execute user code.
- **Tokio**: An asynchronous runtime for Rust, used to manage Deno's event loop and handle non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.

### Key Differences from Node.js

| Feature | Deno | Node.js |
|---------|------|---------|
| Security | Secure by default with permissions | Full system access by default |
| Modules | ES Modules with URL imports | CommonJS with npm packages |
| TypeScript | Built-in support | Requires additional setup |
| Package Management | URL imports with local caching | npm ecosystem with package.json |
| Standard Library | Comprehensive standard library | Minimal core modules |

### Getting Started

```sh
# Installation
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh

# Running a script
deno run https://deno.land/std/examples/welcome.ts

# Running with permissions
deno run --allow-net --allow-read server.ts
```

### Basic Example

```typescript
// Simple HTTP server
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";

serve((req) => new Response("Hello World"), { port: 8000 });
console.log("Server running on http://localhost:8000");
```
