# Context Network Navigation Guide

This document provides a guide to navigating the context network structure.

## Network Structure

The context network is organized into the following main sections:

```
context-network/

    └── node_template.md      # Template for information nodes
```

## Navigation Paths

The context network can be navigated in multiple ways depending on your information needs:

### By Topic

For information about specific topics, start with the appropriate top-level directory:

- **Project Fundamentals**: Start with `foundation/` for high-level information about the project's purpose, structure, and principles.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Explore `elements/` for specific domain knowledge, such as Deno-related information.
- **Processes**: Visit `processes/` for documentation on workflows and procedures.
- **Design Decisions**: Look in `decisions/` for records of architectural and design decisions.

### By Task

For task-oriented navigation:

- **Setting up a new project**: Start with `foundation/project_definition.md`, then explore `processes/creation.md`.
- **Learning about Deno**: Begin with `elements/deno/overview.md` for a high-level introduction, then explore more specific aspects based on your interest.
- **Implementing Deno-based solutions**: Start with `elements/deno/best_practices.md` and `elements/deno/development_workflow.md`.
- **Making architectural decisions**: Use `decisions/decision_template.md` as a guide.

### By Relationship

Information nodes are interconnected through explicit relationships:

- **Parent-Child**: Hierarchical relationships (is-parent-of, is-child-of)
- **Associative**: Related concepts (relates-to, depends-on, implements, extends)
- **Cross-Domain**: Connections across domains (interfaces-with, translates-to)

Follow these relationships (documented in each node's "Relationships" section) to navigate between related concepts.

## Key Entry Points

### For New Users

If you're new to this project and context network:

1. Start with `foundation/project_definition.md` to understand the project's purpose
2. Proceed to `foundation/structure.md` to learn how information is organized
3. Explore `meta/maintenance.md` to understand how to contribute to the context network

### For Deno Development

If you're working with Deno:

1. Begin with `elements/deno/overview.md` for a high-level introduction to Deno
2. For technical architecture, visit `elements/deno/architecture.md`
3. For development guidance:
   - `elements/deno/best_practices.md` for recommended patterns
   - `elements/deno/development_workflow.md` for the complete development lifecycle
   - `elements/deno/testing.md` for testing approaches
4. For specific topics:
   - `elements/deno/security_model.md` for security aspects
   - `elements/deno/module_resolution.md` for module handling
   - `elements/deno/typescript_compilation.md` for TypeScript compilation
   - `elements/deno/frameworks.md` for available frameworks and libraries

### For System Architects

If you're making architectural decisions:

1. Review `foundation/architecture.md` for the overall system architecture
2. Check `decisions/decision_index.md` for existing decisions
3. Use `decisions/decision_template.md` to record new decisions

## Keeping the Network Updated

To track and make updates to the context network:

1. Review `meta/updates.md` to see recent changes
2. Follow guidance in `meta/maintenance.md` for maintenance procedures
3. Use `meta/node_template.md` as a template for creating new information nodes

## Navigation Strategies

Different strategies for exploring the context network:

- **Breadth-first**: Start with overviews (like `foundation/project_definition.md` or `elements/deno/overview.md`) and gradually explore more specific topics.
- **Depth-first**: Focus on a specific area (like Deno security) and explore it deeply before moving to other topics.
- **Task-oriented**: Follow the paths outlined in the "By Task" section above.
- **Relationship-based**: Follow the explicit relationships between nodes to discover related information.

## Future Extensions

As the project evolves, new sections may be added to the context network. Check `meta/updates.md` periodically for information about structural changes and additions.
